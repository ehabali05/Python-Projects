# Python Bank â€” Transaction History Edition

A simple Python banking application with persistent storage and transaction history tracking.

---

## Overview
This project simulates a basic banking system that allows users to:
- Register an account with an optional initial deposit
- Log in securely (currently using plain-text passwords; hashing to be added in future versions)
- Deposit and withdraw funds
- View current balance
- Track full transaction history (deposits and withdrawals)
- Save all data between sessions using a local text file

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Storage:** Local text file (`users.txt`)
- **Core Concepts Used:**
  - File I/O for persistent storage
  - Data parsing and updating
  - Loops and conditional logic
  - User input validation
  - Transaction logging
  - Modular functions for clean code structure

## Development Timeline
After an **11-month gap** from my last GitHub commit, I dedicated part of my August free time to return to coding and push this project forward.  
Each major progression was made on a **different day**, allowing me to learn, refactor, and improve step-by-step.
